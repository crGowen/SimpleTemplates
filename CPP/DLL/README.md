Simple implicit and explicit linking:

Implicit requires also giving out a .lib and .h files with the DLL file

Explicit linking is harder to code for on both ends, but doesn't require distributing the .h and .lib files

In most projects, it's much easier just to use a managed DLL system like in C#.
